# InstacartGroceryAnalysis
Uncovering meaningful  insights from Instacart sales data to refine their market segmentation strategies by conducting thorough exploratory analysis with Python.
# Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis

**Objective**:Instacart is an online grocery store that has already very good sales, but their marketing and sales team want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. My task as a Data Analyst is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

**Key Questions**:
- What are the busiest days and times with most orders?
- Are there particular times of the day when people spend the most money?
- How can product price ranges improve marketing strategies?
- Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others?
- How do customer demographics and behaviors vary in terms of brand loyalty, regional differences, and purchasing patterns?

**Data Source**
The project leverages open-source datasets from Instacart, complemented by specially created customer datasets. These resources are integral to addressing the outlined business questions.

**Tools**
Analysis has been done using Python with the following supporting libraries:
- Pandas: for data analysis
- Numpy: for mathematical equations
- Seaborn: for data visualizations
- Matplotlib: for data visualizations
- SciPy: for mathematical equations

**Project Deliverables**
The project files are stored in following folder structure:
- Analysis: The Visualizations subfolder contains the visualizations used for developing and explaining insights.
- Data: Separated into two subfolders Original Data which contain the original data frames and Prepared Data contain the data frames after they have been cleaned and prepared for analysis. (Data files not uploaded to GitHub due to size limitations.)
- Project Management:  Contains the project brief
- Scripts: Jupyter notebooks contains coding for the analysis
- Sent to Client: [Final report] presented in Excel
